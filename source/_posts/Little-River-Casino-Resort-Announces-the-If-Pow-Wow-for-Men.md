#  Men Will Finally Get Their Own Pow Wow: If in Tigerville

For too long, the pow wow has been a predominantly female-centric event. But that’s all about to change with the advent of Men’s Pow Wow – a new event specifically for men that’s set to take place this weekend in Tigerville.

The brainchild of local man Gerald Ghostbreed, Men’s Pow Wow is designed to give men a safe and comfortable space to celebrate their cultural heritage and connect with other men. “A lot of men feel left out of pow wows,” Ghostbreed says, “so I wanted to create an event that was just for them.”

The two-day event will feature traditional dancing, drumming, and food, as well as workshops on topics like healthy masculinity and fatherhood. There will also be plenty of opportunities for networking and socializing.

So far, the response to Men’s Pow Wow has been overwhelmingly positive. Many men are excited to have a place where they can come together and celebrate their culture without having to worry about being judged or ridiculed. And organizers say that the event is already selling out fast – a clear indication that there is a real demand for it.

If you’re a man looking for an authentic pow wow experience, then be sure to check out Men’s Pow Wow this weekend in Tigerville. You won’t regret it!

#  If Pow Wow is a Gathering Place for Men at Little River Casino Resort

The origins of pow wow can be traced to the 17th century when northeastern Woodlands tribes held ceremonies to give thanks for the harvest. The term “pow wow” is derived from the Ojibwe word “pau wau” which means “to dance.” Pow wow is now a gathering place for men at Little River Casino Resort, where people of all ages can come and partake in the festivities.

There are many different types of pow wows, but most share common elements such as drumming and singing, prayers, and dances. For many people, pow wow is a chance to connect with their cultural heritage. It’s also a time for family members to come together and celebrate their traditions.

If you’re planning on attending a pow wow, there are a few things you should know. First of all, it’s important to dress appropriately. Men should wear long pants and a shirt with sleeves, while women should wear skirts or dresses that go below the knee. It’s also important to be respectful of the proceedings and refrain from talking during prayers and songs.

Finally, don’t forget to bring your camera! Pow wow is a colorful and vibrant celebration that you won’t want to miss.
