When traveling to Las Vegas, the last thing you want to hassle with is figuring out which casino hotel near the airport is best for playing the new Psycho Candy game. 
It's no secret that the stakes are high in Sin City and if you're looking to up your game, it's important to do your research on where to stay.

If you're looking for a luxurious and upscale experience, head over to The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino . With its spacious rooms and suites, world-class shopping and dining options, and elegant decor, this resort is sure to please. Plus, it offers one of the best casino gaming experiences on the Strip. If you're looking for a more relaxed environment with plenty of good games to choose from, then consider Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino .

This property has been around since 1968 and is one of the most popular casinos in town. It doesn't offer all the bells and whistles of some of the newer resorts, but it does have plenty of games available as well as a great amusement park right on site. Plus, at only $29 per night (as of this writing), it's hard to beat the value you'll find here.
