#  Bill Introduced in Lansing to Legalize Online Gambling in Michigan

A bill introduced in Lansing this week could legalize online gambling in Michigan.

The measure, introduced by state Rep. Brandt Iden, would allow the state's 11 tribal casinos to offer online poker, blackjack and other games to people inside Michigan borders. The bill also calls for a study of the potential economic impact of internet gambling in the state.

"I think it has great potential," said Iden, a Republican from Oshtemo Township near Kalamazoo. "There's a lot of interest in it."

#   Supporters of Online Gambling Legalization Come Out in Force 

In what is being seen as a clear sign of support for the legalization of online gambling in the United States, major tech companies and other organizations have filed briefs in favor of a lawsuit seeking to overturn a ban on the activity.

Among the companies lending their support are Amazon, Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft, and Nvidia, as well as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI). They argue that not only is online gambling legal under federal law, but that the ban harms both businesses and consumers.

“This case is about ensuring that outdated laws don’t tie the hands of states and businesses seeking to modernize their operations and provide new choices for consumers,” said Neema Singh Guliani, an attorney with the ACLU.

The lawsuit in question was brought by New Jersey last year after its efforts to legalize online gambling were rebuffed by lawmakers. It is being heard in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.

Officials with some of the companies supporting legalization said that they have long been in favor of overturning the ban, but decided to file briefs after New Jersey’s appeal was denied. They maintain that online gambling can be safely regulated and that it would generate billions of dollars in revenue for states.

Opponents of legalization, including casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, say that it will lead to more addiction and social problems.

#   Michigan May Be Next State to Legalize Online Gambling

Michigan is on the verge of legalizing online gambling, joining a growing number of states that are authorizing internet betting.

Republican state Representative Brandt Iden introduced a bill last week that would legalize and regulate online gambling in Michigan. The bill has broad bipartisan support and is expected to pass.

If the bill becomes law, Michigan will join Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania in allowing online gambling. California is also considering legalizing online gambling this year.

The growth of online gambling reflects the changing attitudes of American voters towards gaming. A recent poll by the Pew Research Center found that 61% of Americans now believe gambling is morally acceptable.

Gambling supporters argue that legalization will generate new tax revenue and create jobs. Opponents argue that it can lead to addiction and other social problems.

Online poker is currently the most popular form of internet gambling, but casinos are increasingly offering other games such as blackjack, slots, and roulette.

The popularity of online gaming has led to a growing industry of software providers and security companies that help casinos protect their systems from cheating and fraud.

#  Online Gambling Bill Headed for Committee Vote in Lansing

The future of online gambling in Michigan is up for a vote in Lansing.

A bill that would legalize and regulate internet gambling was introduced by state Rep. Brandt Iden, R-Oshtemo, last week. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Regulatory Reform.

Iden said the goal of the proposed legislation is to create a regulatory framework for online gambling in Michigan while also generating new revenue for the state.

"This is an emerging industry, and as such, there are a lot of unanswered questions," Iden said in a press release. "This legislation will allow us to study those questions and make sure Michigan does it right."

The proposed bill would allow online casino games, poker and other table games, as well as sports betting. Licenses would cost $5 million each, with 31 licenses available. The Michigan Gaming Control Board would be responsible for regulating the industry.

Revenue from the licenses would be deposited into the School Aid Fund.

The bill has received opposition from anti-gambling groups, who argue that it will increase addiction and crime rates. But others see it as an opportunity to generate new revenue for the state without raising taxes.

"It's something that is long overdue," said Rep. Yousef Rabhi, D-Ann Arbor. "I think it can bring a lot of good jobs to our state and be another tool in the toolbox to make our state more competitive."

#  Online Gambling legalization moves a step closer in Michigan.

Michigan lawmakers have taken a step closer to legalizing online gambling in the state. The motion was approved by the House Regulatory Reform Committee with a vote of nine to five.

Representative Brandt Iden, who proposed the motion, is confident that it will pass through the State House and Senate. He stated that the online gambling legislation is intended to provide more opportunities for Michigan residents to gamble in a safe and regulated environment.

Under the proposed bill, players would be able to bet on sporting events, play casino games, and bet on horse races online. The minimum age for gambling would be set at 21 years old, and casinos would be required to verify the age of players before they are allowed to start playing.

Iden believes that the regulation of online gambling will result in an increase in tax revenue for the state. He pointed out that Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware all generated over $100 million in tax revenue from online gambling in 2017.

The Michigan Gaming Control Board has not taken a position on the proposed bill, but it is likely that they will support it as it would bring more regulated gambling options to the state.
