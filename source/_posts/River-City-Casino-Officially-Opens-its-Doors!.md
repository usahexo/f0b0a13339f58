#  River City Casino Officially Opens its Doors!

The much anticipated River City Casino finally opened its doors to the public this week! The casino, which is located in the heart of downtown St. Louis, is a $365 million development that is expected to create over 1,000 jobs.

Named for the city's iconic riverfront, the new casino features a 120,000-square-foot gaming floor with more than 2,000 slot machines and 60 table games. There is also a 20-story luxury hotel with 342 rooms, as well as several restaurants and bars.

Despite being one of the smaller casinos in Missouri, River City Casino is expected to draw tourists from all over the region. "This casino will have something for everyone," saidDevelopment Director Jeremy Aguilar. "We can't wait for people to experience all that we have to offer."

In addition to its gaming floor and hotel accommodations, River City Casino is also home to the Showboat Branson Belle , one of Missouri's most popular tourist destinations. The theater-style showboat offers dinner cruises on Table Rock Lake with music and comedy performances by some of Branson's biggest stars.

The opening of River City Casino was met with much fanfare this week, with local officials and business leaders heralding it as another sign that St. Louis is on the rise. "This casino is yet another example of St. Louis' resurgence," said Mayor Lyda Krewson at a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Wednesday. "It's creating jobs and boosting our economy, and I can't wait to see what else it brings to our city."
