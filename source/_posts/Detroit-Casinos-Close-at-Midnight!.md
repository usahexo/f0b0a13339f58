#  Detroit Casinos Close at Midnight!

The Detroit casinos are closing their doors at midnight. This move comes as a surprise to many, as the casinos have been a staple in the Motor City for years.

This news has left many people wondering what will become of the city's gaming industry. Some believe that this could be the start of something big, while others are worried about what this could mean for Detroit's economy.

Only time will tell what the future holds for Detroit's casinos. In the meantime, we can only wait and see what happens next.

#  MGM Grand Detroit Closes at 11 p.m.!

The MGM Grand Detroit is one of the most popular casinos in the Detroit area. Located on the outskirts of downtown, it offers a gaming experience like no other casino in the city.

That's why it was so surprising when the casino announced that it would be closing at 11 p.m. beginning January 1, 2019. According to a statement on the MGM Grand Detroit website, the decision was made to "ensure that all guests have an enjoyable and safe experience."

The statement goes on to say that "the safety and security of our guests and team members is always our top priority." It's not clear what prompted the decision, but it has left many people wondering why such a popular casino would close its doors so early.

The closure has caused some concern among local residents and business owners who rely on the casino's traffic for their own businesses. Some have even started a petition to try to convince MGM Grand Detroit to change its policy and stay open later.

So far, MGM Grand Detroit has shown no signs of reversing its decision. In fact, the casino has even gone as far as to post signs at its entrance informing guests that it will be closing at 11 p.m.

#  Greektown Casino Closes at 11 p.m. on Weekdays!

Since the opening of Greektown Casino in November of 2017, the casino has been a popular destination for people living in and around Detroit. With its exciting gaming floor, variety of restaurants, and live entertainment, it’s no wonder that the casino is a popular spot for Michiganders.

However,Greektown Casino announced last week that it will close at 11 p.m. on weekdays. This change goes into effect on Monday, March 18th.

The casino released a statement saying that the decision was made in order to “better align with our business objectives and to provide a more consistent customer experience.” It’s not clear what impact this change will have on the Greektown Casino staff or its customers.

While the casino will still be open until 3am on Friday and Saturday nights, many people are wondering why the weekday closing time was changed from 2am to 11pm.

Some people argue that this change could negatively impact local businesses that rely on Greektown Casino customers late at night. Others believe that this will help to improve customer service by providing a more consistent experience throughout the week.

MotorCity Casino Closes at 2 a.m.!

The casino, located in Detroit, Michigan, is one of the most popular ones in the region. It is one of only two casinos left in Detroit since MGM Grand Detroit Casino and Casino Windsor both closed their doors a few years ago. But now, it looks like MotorCity Casino might soon be joining them.

According to local news sources, MotorCity Casino will be closing its doors at 2 a.m. starting April 1st. This is likely an effort to combat the competition that has been popping up all around it lately. In particular, officials seem to be concerned about Little Caesars Arena andShinola Hotel (both are scheduled to open this year), which are both located close to the casino.

This closure is expected to have a significant impact on the local economy. Not only will it result in job losses for the more than 1,000 employees that work at MotorCity Casino, but it will also reduce tax revenue for the city of Detroit. In fact, MotorCity Casino pays more than $8 million in taxes each year, so this closure could end up costing the city millions of dollars.

#  Winsor casino closes at 11pm Sunday-Thursday

Winsor casino will close at 11pm Sunday-Thursday in order to help ensure the safety of its guests.

The casino will remain open until 2am on Fridays and Saturdays.

“We’re committed to providing a safe and enjoyable experience for our guests, and we believe this change will help us do that,” said casino spokesperson Tamara Young.

The change goes into effect on September 18th.
