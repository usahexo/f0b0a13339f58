The game is played using six dice, and players can bet on individual numbers or combinations of numbers.</p>
<p>Some of the larger payouts for this game include betting on a single number which pays out at 35 to 1, betting on two numbers which pays out at 17 to 1, and betting on three numbers which pays out at 11 to 1. There are also several different combinations that payout at 6 to 1 or 8 to 1.</p>
<p>The game is simple to play, and can be enjoyed by players of all levels of experience. To get started, all you need is a set of six dice and an internet connection. In addition to enjoying the excitement of the game itself, players can also take advantage of the bonuses and rewards that are offered by the online casino.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that this new game will be a popular addition to the casino, and that players will enjoy hours of excitement as they try their luck at winning with dice!</p>
<h1 id="Try-the-New-Casino-Dice-Game-and-Win-Big"><a href="#Try-the-New-Casino-Dice-Game-and-Win-Big" class="headerlink" title="Try the New Casino Dice Game and Win Big!"></a>Try the New Casino Dice Game and Win Big!</h1><p>Looking for a new casino game to try? Why not check out the latest dice game – it’s a lot of fun and there is the potential to win big!</p>
<p>The basics of the game are simple. You roll two dice and try to achieve one of five possible outcomes:</p>
<p>-A total of 7 or 11, which is a ‘natural’ and means you immediately win;<br>-A total of 2, 3 or 12, which is called ‘craps’ and results in you losing;<br>-A total of 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10, which is called a ‘point’; or<br>-A combination of two different numbers (e.g. 5 and 2).</p>
<p>If you roll the same number twice (e.g. 5 and 5), this is called a ‘double’ and you get another turn. If you then roll the same number again (5), you would have ‘tripled down’ on that number.</p>
<p>The aim of the game is to keep rolling the dice until you either achieve your point (i.e. roll a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10) or roll craps (2, 3 or 12). If you manage to achieve your point before rolling craps, you win!</p>
<p>When playing casino dice games there are various bets that can be made but as a beginner we recommend sticking to the basic bet which is simply betting on whether the dice will add up to 7 or 11 on the first roll (a win) or not (a loss). This way you don’t have to worry about any other combinations until you’re more comfortable with how the game works. </p>
<p> To make this bet all players must place their chips in front of them in an area marked “PASS LINE”. The dealer will then give two dice to one player who will hold onto them throughout the course of the game. These dice are passed around after each roll so everyone can see what has been rolled. </p>
<p> The player who rolls the dice at the beginning of each turn is known as the “shooter”. All other players can make different bets based on what they think will happen next - for example, that the shooter will roll a 7 or 11 (a “win”) on their next go, or that they’ll roll craps instead (a lose). </p>

<p>In addition to the excitement factor, dice games also offer relatively good odds when compared to other types of casino games. This means that players can enjoy some potential big wins while playing these games, which only adds to the excitement.</p>
<p>Finally, dice games are just plain fun to play! They are easy to learn but provide enough complexity and excitement to keep players engaged for hours on end. If you are looking for a new casino game to try out, then be sure to check out some of the great dice games available online today.</p>
